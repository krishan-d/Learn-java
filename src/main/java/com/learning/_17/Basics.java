        // Sealed Classes (Standard) :
        // They allow developers to restrict which classes or interfaces can extend or implement a given class or interface.
        // Pros:
        // 1. Improves the design and security of APIs.
        // 2. Helps enforce a controlled set of subclasses, making code more predictable and easier to maintain.
